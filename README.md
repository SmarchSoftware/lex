# Lex
A game-currency management package. Everything need to add / edit / manage your game's version of currency (pennies, dollars, gold, silver, bucks, dineros, crystals, pounds, etc...) and their relation to each other. Set your lowest form currency (for example - penny) as the base and then add higher / more value versions of that base. (i.e. "dollar" = "100 base" currency)

Lex will do the math for you.

Lex will also let you set options on the currencies you add. Perhaps your "gold" can't be bought or sold or traded, only found. Sure, you can do that. Or maybe you decide you don't want your game to use "silver" any more. De-value it or disable it altogether.

If you have a need for in-game currency management this will be a package to help with that.
